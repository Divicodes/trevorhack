Safety Planning Overview
Safety plans can look very different from conversation to conversation, and Counselors should always let the Contact take the lead in deciding what they’re willing to try. However, the guidelines in this article can be helpful when working to establish clear plans for Contacts to engage in to stay safe after they have ended their conversation with a Counselor. 

●	Low & Medium Risk: For Low and Medium Risk Contacts, safety planning generally comes up near the end of Exploring Alternatives after a Contact has de-escalated. There may be cases with Low and Medium Risk Contacts where they are not open to developing a safety plan, that is okay! Meet the Contact where they are, follow their lead, and exploring the feelings that safety planning brings up for them if they are open to it.
●	Imminent Risk: For Imminent Risk Contacts, Counselors should immediately flag a Supervisor following the Risk Assessment to alert them of the Contact's risk level. Then Counselors should immediately shift the focus of the conversation towards active safety planning and gathering additional information about the situation at hand. Developing a solid safety plan is the least invasive method if intervention for an imminent safety risk and can prevent an active intervention from being initiated. Counselors should stay in consistent communication with the Supervisor and follow the Active Intervention Policy, if necessary.
What is a Safety Plan?
A safety plan is a detailed, specific, organized, actionable, and collaboratively developed plan that a Contact can utilize to stay safe for a specific period of time, or in response to unique pressures or situations that may arise. Safety planning can be used in any situation where a Contact is in danger of harming themself, harming others, or being harmed by someone else. Safety plans can contain one or more steps to help someone stay safe, either on their own or until help arrives.

Safety planning may include working with a Contact to:

●	Identify triggers or warning signs of distress;
●	Identify coping skills;
●	Identify support systems;
●	Consider what social supports or distractions are available;
●	Separate from means; and/or
●	Explore available professional resources.

For example, Counselors may want to encourage a Contact to remove means for suicide or self-harm; ask if a Contact wants to open up to trusted adults about their primary issue(s); or support a Contact in writing down coping strategies and self-care activities that they can utilize when feeling unsafe or in need of emotional support. Safety plans require active engagement and participation from the Contact.
Why Safety Plan?
Safety planning helps ensure that a Contact can stay safe from imminent harm when experiencing thoughts of suicide, or when responding to specific pressures or situations. By leaning into a Contact’s knowledge and experience, safety plans prioritize the Contact’s agency in determining what will be most helpful for them. Ideally, a safety plan can mitigate future crises by allowing a Contact to explore deescalation strategies before entering into a state of emergency, and reduces the likelihood that third parties will be involved without a Contact’s consent.  

While callbacks can be an important part of safety planning, they are not sufficient as a safety plan alone. By setting up solid safety plans with our Contacts in addition to providing callbacks, we can provide our Contacts with additional tools and resources to explore when in crisis. Furthermore, there are many situations in which safety planning may be useful to a Contact who is not at imminent risk of suicide. For example, safety planning around practices of self-harm, substance use, or bullying could help a Contact stay safe in many types of situations where they may be at risk of harm. See the Outgoing Call Protocols article for more detailed information. 
Key Principles for Counselors
When working with a Contact to explore or develop a Safety Plan, the following principles are important to keep in mind:

●	Work together to develop the plan.
●	Make sure the plan is tailored for each individual.
●	Orient the plan toward a harm reduction approach.
●	Utilize existing social and professional supports.
●	Identify sources of 24-hour support (e.g., The Trevor Project, 988 Lifeline, etc.)
●	Encourage the Contact to document the plan by writing or typing it out and saving it for future reference.
●	A Contact should affirm their willingness and ability to engage in the safety plan for it to be considered a solid plan.  A safety plan should include steps that can be taken within the immediate time frame of risk.

Identifying Resources for a Safety Plan
Depending on what type of resources a Contact has access to or identifies as being helpful, safety plans may include both internal and external resources.

Internal resources are things that a Contact has access to on their own, or within themselves. Examples of internal resources include coping strategies such as journaling, exploring/identifying personal triggers, engaging in physical activity, or utilizing breathing exercises.

External resources are people or places that a Contact has access to that they can turn to for support. Examples of external resources include things such as spending time with a pet; exploring/identifying social supports such as a supportive guardian, friend, family member, or teacher; exploring/identifying possible professional supports such as a school counselor, a therapist, or doctor; or discussing/identifying local or national resources, such as those available in Resources for Contacts. Resources for Contacts is a searchable repository of staff-reviewed resources in H2CS. Its resources cover a myriad of topics that might be useful in supporting our Contacts, such as:

●	Bullying
●	Child Abuse
●	Eating Disorders
●	School
●	Self-Injury
●	Sexual Assault and Rape
●	Substance Use and Addiction
