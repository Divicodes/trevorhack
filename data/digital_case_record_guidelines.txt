Please do your best to fill out the case record during the chat and save regularly. You can always complete any remaining fields or add additional information after the chat ends. 
Case Detail
You can complete the following fields during the conversation. Fields that will auto-populate are marked with [brackets]. Note that “Case Status” should only be changed after the conversation has ended. 

1.	Risk Level: Indicates the risk level that you have determined based on the Risk Assessment. This section does not need to be manually filled out, as it is also based off of the info from the RA section. This section can be used if the auto-populated Risk does not match the actual risk and needs to be manually updated for any reason.
2.	[Risk]: This section will auto-populate based on your documentation of the Risk Assessment. If you notice a mismatch between your determination and the risk level that populates, you should check the Risk Assessment section below. 
3.	Primary Issue: You can select the contact’s presenting issue from the dropdown list OR select other and fill in the “Other - Primary Issue” field below. 
4.	Secondary Issue(s): Select or write in any secondary reasons that brought the contact to Trevor. 
5.	[Case Origin]: Indicates how the contact is reaching out to Trevor: Phone, Chat or Text.

Personal Information & Contact/Identifying Information
Make sure to fill out these fields as you gather personal information from the contact in the first few minutes of the conversation: 
●	First name
●	Age: Age will determine the time limit of the conversation. If the contact does not disclose their age, mark this field as “0.”
●	City
●	State
 
Reminder: All other fields should only be completed if the contact discloses relevant  information to you directly during the conversation. Detailed location information like “Residence type” and “School name” should be documented if collected.
 
Risk Assessment Documentation
The Risk Assessment (RA) section reflects the “yes” and “no” paths of the Risk Assessment Decision Tree. You should complete the Risk Assessment section of the case record as you ask the contact the respective questions and save the case record as you go.

If the youth answers “yes” to “Are you thinking of killing yourself?” then you will answer the questions in the left column (i.e., the “yes path”). If the youth answers “no,” you will answer the questions in the right column (i.e., the “no path.”). Do not fill out both columns. 

Below are some tips for a well-documented RA:
●	If the contact provides an ambiguous answer to an RA question (e.g. a contact responds “kinda” to an RA question), please attempt to clarify with the contact. Include any clarifying information gathered in the Additional Details sections of the RA box.
●	For open-ended RA questions, enter the contact’s response.
●	Sometimes information from the "yes" path will organically come up even if you are following the "no" path (particularly about past attempts). If you gather this information, it is fine to fill out the appropriate yes-path field - it will not mess up the Risk Assessment - and may be helpful down the road.
