0:nice to meet you. what's going on?
1:hi basically im feeling really anxious. im trying to come out to my parents but im worried how theyll react to me.
0:Thanks for sharing all that with me, Riley. What kind of reaction are you afraid of them having?
1:i don't know, id like to come out and be myself but im afraid they wont accept me for who i am
0:Seems like you're gearing up for a pretty vulnerable conversation with your family, and you're not sure how they'll react. With everything that's going on, Riley, do you think some resources, like having a good therapist, could help?
1:sure. i think a therapist could really help me. can you suggest some therapists in my area?
0:Tamara Denise Pena, Maria da Silva, Bryan Blakeny, and Jaleesia Rosemond are great therapists in Houston.
1:thx
