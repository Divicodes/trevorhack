Partially Disclosed Plans Cheat Sheet
The RA questions are designed to ensure Counselors obtain consistent information about a Contact’s plan, means, and timeframe in order to assess their risk for suicide per our RA. Though Counselors are trained to ask the RA questions following the order using the wording as written, it is possible that a Contact may share information about their plan for suicide prior to beginning the RA or prior to a particular question being asked during the RA. These are called partially disclosed plans.  If that is the case, it is important to thoroughly clarify the plan, means, and/or timeframe they’ve shared and continue with the RA.

In scenarios where a Contact shares all or some of their suicide plan prior to the Risk Assessment, it is important that Counselors reflect and clarify what the Contact has specifically shared to better understand the Contact’s plan while maintaining rapport. Counselors should use the RA questions as a guide or checklist to ensure they’ve sufficiently clarified the Contact’s plan. 

Here are some examples in which the RA may need to be amended to successfully clarify the Contact’s suicide plan:
Example 1
Counselor: Are you thinking of killing yourself?

Contact: Yeah
Counselor: Thank you for sharing that with me. How are you thinking of killing yourself? 
Contact: I’m thinking of hanging myself tonight.
●	Note that the Contact shared their time frame without prompting. For now, the Counselor should continue the RA by asking appropriate follow-up questions.

Counselor: How were you planning to hang yourself?
Contact: I was planning to use a belt.
Counselor: I appreciate you sharing that with me. Where is the belt right now? 
Contact: It’s in my bedroom.
Counselor: Okay. Where are you [chatting/texting/calling] me from right now?
Contact: I’m at school.
Counselor: Thanks, [name]. I want to check in on your safety - have you done anything today to try to kill yourself? 
Contact: No.
●	Because the Contact shared their timeframe (“tonight”) earlier on, it may damage rapport if the Counselor were to ask, “When are you thinking of killing yourself?”  Instead, the Counselor should clarify when tonight the Contact is planning to kill themselves. 

Counselor: Okay, I just want to make sure I'm understanding you correctly. You have a plan to hang yourself with a belt, and you haven't done anything to act on that plan yet today, but you mentioned earlier that you’re thinking of doing it tonight. When tonight are you thinking of killing yourself?” 
●	Upon receiving an answer that provides sufficient clarity,  the Counselor may proceed through the remaining RA questions, starting with “Where are you thinking of killing yourself?”
