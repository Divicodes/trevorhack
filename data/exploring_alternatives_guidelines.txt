Some Contacts come to our service looking for advice on how to handle a problem or situation. Because a short-term crisis Counselor could never fully understand the complexities of their issue, refrain from offering advice on what Contacts should do next. Instead, use open-ended questions to explore the following: 

●	Ways the Contact has coped in the past
●	What the Contact has considered doing to cope
●	Activities that serve as distractions 
○	What do they enjoy doing?
●	How they feel about their options
○	Do they want to brainstorm alternatives together?
●	What gives the Contact purpose
○	What are things in their life that make you feel whole?
Harm Reduction 
Our Contacts experience a wide range of circumstances that involve varying degrees of risk or potential harm, which might stem from the Contact’s present environment, coping skills, or plans made for the future. As Counselors, our role is to center the Contact’s perspective and agency, trusting that they know their situation best and are best positioned to make decisions for their life. 

Harm Reduction refers to mitigating or reducing the potential harm associated with a variety of behaviors, including but not limited to self-injury, drug and alcohol use,  and sexual activities. This framework explores and presents options for taking situations and behaviors that involve risk of harm and making them safer, in small or large degrees, in nonjudgmental, non-prescriptive ways. 
Principles for Harm Reduction
1.	Follow the Contact’s lead 
2.	Validate the feeling behind the potentially harmful behavior instead of the behavior itself
a.	Explore the reason for the behavior and the feeling achieved by it 
3.	Validate the Contact for working to find coping strategies that work for them 
4.	Preserve and respect the Contact’s autonomy
Tools for Harm Reduction
●	Frequency of harm 
○	What would it feel like to self-injure less often?
○	What would it feel like to use [insert substance] less frequently?
●	Cleanliness + infection prevention
○	How does the Contact ensure cleanliness in their substance use?
○	How does the Contact clean and care for self-injury on the body?
●	Questions from Contacts
○	It is important that Counselors do not provide medical advice to a Contact, including but not limited to information on cleaning, pressure, elevation, lethality, or other wound care. Refer to the Medical Questions section for further information and advice. 
●	Emotional, Physical and Social Cues
○	Support the Contact in identifying warning cues of a behavior
○	Explore the possibility of removing or changing those warning cues.
